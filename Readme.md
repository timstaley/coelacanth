*There's life in the old fish yet.*

#### What is this?
*Coelacanth* is an ongoing effort to resurrect a collection of C++ codes I wrote for lucky-imaging data-reduction and analysis, as described in my [PhD thesis]. The hope is that it might be useful either in whole, in part, or as a cautionary lesson in how we used to do things.

#### What's the fish got to do with it?
**Co**des for **E**MCCD and **l**ucky-imaging **a**nalysis == **COELA**, but 'coelacanth' is more memorable. 
That, and [C++03] is a bit of a dinosaur.

#### This sounds useful. How do I get started?
Unfortunately there's no documentation for the code yet, and progress is slow as this is effectively a side-project.
However, if you're interested in digging in, do [get in touch] and I'll help out if I can.
