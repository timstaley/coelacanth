*There's life in the old fish yet*

#### What is this?
Coelacanth is an ongoing effort to resurrect a collection of C++ codes I wrote for lucky-imaging data reduction and analysis, as described in my [PhD thesis]. The hope is that it might be useful either in whole, in part, or as a cautionary lesson in how we used to things.

#### What's the fish got to do with it?
**C**ode **o**riginally for **E**MCCD and **l**ucky-imaging **a**nalysis == **COELA**, but coelacanth is much more memorable, no?
That, and [C++03] is a bit of a dinosaur.
